In my first interleaving bug, I put a thread_yield in linked_list_create_node() function. 
I put this immediately after the line that calls kmalloc to allocate space for a Linked_List_Node struct. 
My prediction was that this will cause an issue because it yields the thread before assigning any of the data to the new node. 
Therefore, it won't be able to properly create nodes.

In reality, the error came when it tried to remove nodes.
Removing in one thread was not a problem, but once it tried to remove in the other thread, the kernel panicked.
