For the third interleaving, I put a thread yield before and after the line that increments the count in linked_list_insert.
This should cause the program to lose count of the number of items in the list.
In observation, this did in fact happen. At one point during the running, it prints that a list that should have size 6 has size 5, meaning it did not properly update the size.
Later, though, it fails to decrement the size, meaning these issues cancel out, resulting in the program ending up with the correct count by the end of its run.
However, it still does not perform as expected.
